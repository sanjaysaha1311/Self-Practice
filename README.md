# Self Practice

This repository contains the codes, notes (optionally) from the coding tutorials, exercises, that I follow for my own practice.

Some of the codes here are followed from tutorial/articles listed in my other repo on [Computer Vision and ML Learning Resources](https://github.com/sanjaysaha1311/Computer-Vision-ML-Lerning-Resources).
